* Minimal Emacs configuration for speed and sanity

This is a minimal configuration for Emacs, that has the most important (to me)
bits and pieces from [[https://github.com/emacs-exordium/exordium][exordium]] and my config that decreases a possibility of me
loosing my sanity.

** Usage
The assumption is that [[https://iterm2.com][iTerm2]] is used.

   #+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/pkryger/emacs-sanity.git ~/.emacs-sanity
emacs -nw --init-directory ~/.emacs-sanity
   #+end_src

From time to time, you may want to update installed packages. I usually do =M-x
package-list-packages= followed by =U x=.

A few keybindings are defined, type =M-x describe-personal-keybindings= to see
them.
