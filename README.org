* Minimal Emacs configuration for speed and sanity

  This is a minimal configuration for Emacs, that has the most important (to me) bits and pieces from [[https://github.com/emacs-exordium/exordium][exordium]] and my config that decreases a possibility of me loosing my sanity.

** Usage
   The assumption is that [[https://iterm2.com][iTerm2]] is used.

   #+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/pkryger/emacs-sanity.git ~/.emacs-sanity
emacs --quick -nw -l ~/.emacs-sanity/sanity.el
   #+end_src

   From time to time, you may want to update installed packages. I usually do
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (package-list-packages)
   #+end_src
   followed by =U=.
